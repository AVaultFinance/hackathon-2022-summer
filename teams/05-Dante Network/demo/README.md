## Demo to try

### Simple scenarios
* We provide some simple scenarios to demonstrate how dApps can access to multi-ecosystems with the help of Dante protocol stack. [Try it manually](./interoperation/).

### Algorithm prototype
* To make users more intuitively to understand how the underly algorithms work, we provide this on-chain prototype smart contract to show the effects of the underlying mechanisms implemented in ink!. [Try it manually](../src/ink!/algorithm-prototype/).
