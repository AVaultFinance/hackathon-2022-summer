## Background

A significant missing piece of Web3 is an automatic middleware to handle the on-chain event, that helps the user encapsulate the on-chain raw data, and distribute and push what just happened in real time on chain. Web3 players have always paid for Information building, latency and asynchrony:

  - [ ] The builders have put lots of time to get on-chain data: either use third-party tools(TheGrpah, Subquery) or build their own backend.
  - [ ] There is no convenient tool for common users to know the activities for a specific protocol, and normally professional knowledge is needed to filter useful information.

SubAuto is such a middleware that helps the user access the Polkadot, which provides:
  - [ ]  SubAPI to help the user access the on-chain historical and real-time data
  - [ ] SubPush to help the user to get custom notifications of the on-chain through different channels.

## Product Highlight

Subpush is a push-notification dapp that monitors real-time on-chain activities and provides automatic reminder service that available on different ends.
With our product, you’ll be able to own a data-listening intelligent assistant. Our product can support to monitor below on-chain data：

**Address activities** 

  - [ ]  When transaction activity occurs on specific address, no more refreshing the page or having to watch each new block and create custom filters to track user’s data. The Address activities can be easily pushed by our dapp and pop out on your customized channels.

**Special transactions** 

  - [ ]  You'll be able to know exactly when the deposits, purchases, in-game actions or other on-chain activities officially happened — the perfect time to re-engage in and continue to use a Web3 application.

Not limited to real-time data service, our product provides a Unified Data Platform to make it easy to integrate data pushing service into various public chains.

**Easy Setup**

  - [ ] Everyone can set up pushing service on their own without any coding experience. With our service, people can tailor their reminders based on default template.

## Future Planning
### 3-Month Plan
  - [ ] Our short-term plan is to focus on expanding our data scope and providing more messaging channels. We plan to support different protocals, including Defi service, Gaming, NFT, Staking and other web3 service. Subpush will be first available on Polkadot and Moonbeam, then it will migrate to other public chains. Also, We plan to support more communication channels, including Discord, Slack,. etc.

### 1-Year Plan
**Social-Fi**

  - [ ] Our long-term plan is to create a data analytical community which contains PGC and UGC.  As a team with good blockchain data analytical experience, we hope to tell all the players how data push can turn into real benefit, thus we will launch a bunch of professional push recommendations based on wallet analysis.
Not limited to data pushing template from our team, we will start a bounty program to attract data analysts to participate data analysis competition. In the games, users will find out good analysts , follow them and learn from them. Good analysts will stand out , grow into KOL and earn benefits.

**Programmable mode for advanced developers**

  - [ ]  Expect for providing no-coding mode for non-technicians, we also plan to launch a  integrated programmable platform consists programmable pushing service modules. Advanced developers can reuse our data service that is consisted of coding template and online testing tools

## Commerical Value

**Cost reduction through improved data quality**

  - [ ]  As mentioned before, our product fill the gap of real-time pushing service. users don’t have such a easy-to-use tool to get cross-chain data notification on time. Our product can allow users to have a intelligent reminder, with customized data service . We can help users save time and turn data into action as soon as possible.
Not only easy-to use mode provided for retail investors, institutions or advanced developers can also use our data pushing service to build their own intelligent data notifying network, which can be integrated with other data service, like data visualization and data modeling.

**Bounty Program**

  - [ ] With bounty program, our dapp can be a great platform for projects to expand influence. Users need to learn the whole story of project in order to create useful data push, which can help project easily find out their seed users.

**KOL**

  - [ ] Data push is a public watchlist and users’ watchlist reflects their potential trade. As someone’s data push get trusted by more and more people, he’s considered experts on certain topic and often regarded as trustworthy. A KOL can not only help projects target your ideal audience, promote tools and projects, but also cause crowd effect that is very powerful.

**Data value**

  - [ ] Data push can directly reflect what users are keeping an eye on. Statistic about data push, like how many people are watching on some specific address, how many people are monitoring some specific chain, can become a significant parameter to measure potential financial impact of specific address, specific action, or specific chain. It’s also possible to predict trading trends through users’ pushing data. 

## Plan to Develop
**An on-chain listening framework**

The framework can be used to real-time monitor custom events/extrinsic and to trigger the following action. This framework can easily migrate to other para-chains/relay-chains and EVM-compatible chains. 

**A message triggering framework**

The framework is used to distribute the on-chain event by message and provides APIs for the third party to integrate

**One dApp**

Users can use to customize the on-chain event to be monitored, the functions are listed as follows: 
 - [ ] Monitor wallet address, gas fee, LPs of StellaSwap and Zenlink, and bridges
 
 - [ ] Integrate multiple message distribution channels

 - [ ] Provide the webhook for the third party for the dApps development
