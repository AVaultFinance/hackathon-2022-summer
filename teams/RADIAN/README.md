## About RADIAN

RADIAN is an open sourced infrastructure allowing developers to launch web3-ready social platforms and to enable Decentralized Society. RADIAN accelerates crypto adoption by creating social scenarios using blockchain at the same time offering solutions for problems in web2. Users will be able to enjoy free speech, own and monetize their content and relationships. RADIAN offers SGAAS (Social Graph As A Service). Users can build a truly decentralized social graph on the RADIAN protocol, and developers can launch various Web3 Social Dapps or plug-ins based on the RADIAN Protocol.
